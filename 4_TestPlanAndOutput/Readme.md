# High Level Test Plan

# HL1
Valid input is given from user end. For invalid input exit the function and terminate the code.

# HL2
Handles bundary condition. For invalid input exit the function and terminate the code.

# HL3
Flow of jumping from one function to other. For invalid input exit the function and terminate the code.


# Low Level Test Plan

# LL1
For addition function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL2
For subtraction function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL3
For multiplication function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL4
For division function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL5
For modulous function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL6
For factorial function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.
