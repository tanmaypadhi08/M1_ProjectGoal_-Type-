# Introduction
Generally we use a calculator for various application in our daily livelihood. Whether it is a engineering student or a vendor, everybody uses a calculator for their own purpose.
In this project, I made a calcultor which perform basic arithematic operations and also factors, modulous and power function to have some additional features in the calcuator.


The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.


# SWOT Analysis

STRENGTHS

The ultimate strength of this Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc. It can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime

WEAKNESSES

Very less application and covers only basic arithematic operations with few scientific terms

OPPORTUNITIES

The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. 

THREATS

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.


# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

HLR1
User is able to viewe operation list

HLR2
User is able to select the operation

HLR3
The system should able perform the given operation


# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

LLR1
Takes only interger as input value. Doesn'e consider float variables

LLR2
One option only perform single operation and you can only perform next operation when the previous operation is completed

# High Level Test Plan

# HL1
Valid input is given from user end. For invalid input exit the function and terminate the code.

# HL2
Handles bundary condition. For invalid input exit the function and terminate the code.

# HL3
Flow of jumping from one function to other. For invalid input exit the function and terminate the code.


# Low Level Test Plan

# LL1
For addition function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL2
For subtraction function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL3
For multiplication function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL4
For division function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL5
For modulous function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.

# LL6
For factorial function, input and output both are int type. The float input value will not generate desired result instead it will give output in integer type only.
