# Introduction
Generally we use a calculator for various application in our daily livelihood. Whether it is a engineering student or a vendor, everybody uses a calculator for their own purpose.
In this project, I made a calcultor which perform basic arithematic operations and also factors, modulous and power function to have some additional features in the calcuator.


The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
